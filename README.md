# Face Pong - Camera-Controlled Game üéÆüì∑

## **Overview**
Face Pong is a web-based game built with **React** that uses **TensorFlow.js** for facial tracking. The player moves the paddle using their **nose position** detected through the webcam.

## **How It Works**
1. **Webcam Access** - The app uses `react-webcam` to access the camera.
2. **Face Detection** - `@tensorflow-models/facemesh` tracks the position of the player‚Äôs **nose**.
3. **Paddle Movement** - The paddle moves up and down based on the **Y-coordinate of the nose**.
4. **Gameplay** - The goal is to hit the ball using face movements.

## **Installation & Running the Game**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, run:
## Challenges Faced
Setting up TensorFlow.js and FaceMesh for accurate face tracking.
Adjusting paddle movement sensitivity for smooth controls.
Ensuring the ball bounces correctly to keep the game challenging.
## Future Improvements
Add background music and sound effects.
Implement a high score tracking system.
Improve face tracking accuracy for better responsiveness.
